      "https://www.jlmlubricants.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Achtergrond-scaled.jpg",
    text: "Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engines have revolutionised the automotive industry by offering improved fuel efficiency and enhanced performance. However, these technological advancements come with their own set of challenges, particularly concerning carbon deposit buildup. Unlike traditional Multi-Port Injection (MPI) engines, GDI engines are more prone to specific types of deposits that require dedicated cleaning solutions. In this article, we’ll explore why GDI deposits need a specialised petrol injector cleaner and how it differs from the commonly used injector cleaning additives. ",

      {
        code_description: "Multi-Port Injection (MPI) Engines",
        details:
          "In MPI engines, fuel is injected into the intake manifold where it mixes with air before entering the combustion chamber. This process allows fuel to wash over the intake valves, helping to keep them relatively clean. Traditional injector cleaning additives from SEB Wholesale Distributors Inc. are designed to address deposits in the intake manifold and on the injectors, ensuring smooth fuel delivery and combustion.",

        code_description: "Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) Engines",
        details:
          "In GDI engines, fuel is injected directly into the combustion chamber at high pressure. This design improves fuel atomization and combustion efficiency, leading to better performance and fuel economy. However, because fuel does not pass over the intake valves, these valves are more susceptible to carbon buildup. This buildup can significantly impact engine performance, causing rough idling, reduced power, and increased emissions.",

      {
        code_description: "Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves",
        details:
          "One of the primary issues with GDI engines is the accumulation of carbon deposits on the intake valves. Since these valves are not exposed to fuel, they do not benefit from the cleaning properties of traditional fuel additives. Over time, oil vapors from the crankcase ventilation system and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) systems can lead to the formation of stubborn carbon deposits on the intake valves. SEB Wholesale Distributors Inc.'s Direct Injection Valve Cleaner is specifically designed to effectively remove these typical GDI deposits.",

While traditional injector cleaning additives are effective for MPI engines, they fall short in addressing the unique challenges faced by GDI systems.
