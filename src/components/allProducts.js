Red Line 75W90 Gear Oil provides excellent protection in nearly all differentials, conventional and limited slip, in both racing and street use. 75W90NS and 75W140NS can be used in certain limited-slip units in racing to lock-up the differential. 80W140 should be used in commercial hauling, problem limited-slip units, racing applications which see tremendous torque at low speeds, and where noise deadening is desired. 75W85 can be used to obtain maximum power transfer in racing differentials which do not see extremely high temperatures and improved efficiency in street differentials. If “chattering” occurs with any of these lubricants, Red Line Limited Slip Friction Modifier can be used to eliminate the stick/slip action and reduce the noise. This additive should not be necessary in the 75W85, 75W90, 75W110, 75W140 or the 80W140 Gear Oils, since they already contain this additive, but in some units more is required.
