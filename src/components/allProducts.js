    description: "Motor oil is made from crude oil and is used to lubricate, clean, and cool engines. Types of motor oil include conventional, synthetic, diesel, bio-based, hybrid (blends of conventional and synthetic), and recycled oils. Motor oil varies in weight and viscosity, as well as additives that some manufacturers add to the oil during the refining process. A numerical code system created by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) grades motor oils according to viscosity, the higher the number between 0 and 60, the more viscous (thicker) the oil is. Most consumer motor oils are graded by two numbers, with the first number indicating cold weather (Winter or 'W') performance. This oil has a weight of SAE 40, meaning it has a single SAE viscosity rating of 40 at normal operating temperature. Always check your vehicle's owner's manual to verify that this is the correct weight of motor oil for your vehicle. This oil is fully synthetic, meaning crude oil is not used in making it. Synthetic oil can be used in vehicle engines instead of motor oils refined from crude oil, and often provides superior mechanical performance over traditional motor oil, including increased gas mileage and reduced engine wear at extreme temperatures. Its complex method of production means it can often cost more than conventional motor oil. Royal Purple Motor Oil Combines premium base oils with proprietary additive technologies to create high performance motor oils that optimize engine performance and provide superior protection. No special procedures are necessary when upgrading to Royal Purple. Royal Purple recommends waiting until the manufacturer's first scheduled oil change in new gasoline engines before upgrading to Royal Purple. Royal Purple's API licensed motor oil delivers superior protection and improves performance in gasoline and diesel engines.

Red Line 75W90 Gear Oil provides excellent protection in nearly all differentials, conventional and limited slip, in both racing and street use. 75W90NS and 75W140NS can be used in certain limited-slip units in racing to lock-up the differential. 80W140 should be used in commercial hauling, problem limited-slip units, racing applications which see tremendous torque at low speeds, and where noise deadening is desired. 75W85 can be used to obtain maximum power transfer in racing differentials which do not see extremely high temperatures and improved efficiency in street differentials. If “chattering” occurs with any of these lubricants, Red Line Limited Slip Friction Modifier can be used to eliminate the stick/slip action and reduce the noise.
