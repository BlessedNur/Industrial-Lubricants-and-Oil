The unique combination of base stocks and additives allow Red Line gear oils to carry higher loads compared to petroleum lubricants. The stability of these products allow them to be used for extended periods. Red Line 75W90 Gear Oil provides excellent protection in nearly all differentials, conventional and limited slip, in both racing and street use. 75W90NS and 75W140NS can be used in certain limited-slip units in racing to lock-up the differential. 80W140 should be used in commercial hauling, problem limited-slip units, racing applications which see tremendous torque at low speeds, and where noise deadening is desired. 75W85 can be used to obtain maximum power transfer in racing differentials which do not see extremely high temperatures and improved efficiency in street differentials. If “chattering” occurs with any of these lubricants, Red Line Limited Slip Friction Modifier can be used to eliminate the stick/slip action and reduce the noise. This additive should not be necessary in the 75W85, 75W90, 75W110, 75W140 or the 80W140 Gear Oils, since they already contain this additive, but in some units more is required. Too much friction modifier can reduce the lockup in limited slip units, so it should only be used if needed.",

          "Enclosed industrial gear systems Recommended for industrial reduction gear systems operating under severe operating conditions, such as high load, very low or elevated temperatures and wide temperature variations.",
          "Other applications Shell Omala S4 GX 220 oil is suitable for lubrication of bearings and other components in circulating and splash-lubricated systems.For geared systems, or Other applications that employ a filtration unit finer than 5 microns, please consult your Shell Local Technical Advisor and Product Application Specialist before using Shell Omala S4 GX",

        "Long oil life – maintenance saving Shell Omala S4 GX ISO 220 gear oil is formulated using an advanced additive system in combination with specially selected synthetic base fluids to provide outstanding resistance to breakdown over long duration and/or high temperature operation. Shell Omala S4 GX can operate successfully at bulk temperatures up to 120C. Shell Omala S4 GX 220 offers the potential to significantly extend service intervals compared to conventional industrial gear oils.",
        "Excellent wear and corrosion protection Shell Omala S4 GX ISO VG 220 gear oil is formulated to have excellent load carrying capacity and micro-pitting performance providing long component life even under shock loading conditions. These features provide benefits over mineral oil-based products in terms of gear and bearing component life. Shell Omala S4 GX 220 gear oil also has excellent corrosion protection, even in the presence of contamination by water and solids.",
        "Maintaining system efficiency Shell Omala S4 GX 220 gear oil can help maintain or enhance the efficiency of industrial gear systems through improved low temperature performance and lower friction in comparison to mineral oil-based products. This provides better lubrication at low start-up temperatures",
