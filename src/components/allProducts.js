      intro:
        "With the increasingly tighter tolerances of modern equipment, bulk filtration is more important than ever. Dirty fuel and lubricants are emerging as leading causes of equipment downtime.  From damage to injectors and pumps to unpredictable filter plugging, contamination in diesel and oil can bring critical machinery to a halt.Bulk Filtration can help maximize equipment availability by putting the cleanest fuels and lubricants into your mission-critical equipment.  Installing a Donaldson Clean Solutions bulk filtration system is the easiest and most cost effective way to do this. Fluids in your storage tank can be thousands of times dirtier than recommended by equipment manufacturers.  Donaldson’s bulk filtration cleans this contamination out of the fluid in a single-pass, minimizing system complexity and size.  These modular systems are available for any fluid or flow rate.  Several filter options are available based on viscosity and cleanliness requirements. Shop Lubricants is the expert in designing, installing and servicing Clean Solutions systems.  We will work with you to make sure you put the cleanest possible fuel and lubes into your equipment and make sure you KEEP RUNNING. Submit a contact form or call us today!",

      intro:
        "Castrol EDGE is Castrol’s most advanced engine oil. It is a premium full synthetic oil that is designed for consumers who demand the best performance from their cars. Castrol EDGE is recommended by leading car manufacturers. Castrol EDGE is engineered with fluid titanium technology that physically changes the way the oil behaves under pressure. As a result of increased demand for performance and fuel economy, pressures in today’s engines have almost doubled over the last three decades. Greater pressure means more stress for the oil and the potential for more friction. As metal to metal contact increases, it causes wear and reduces performance. Underneath the hood, the pressure can reach 10 tons per square centimeter. That’s like five cars resting on a high heel relying only on a micro thin layer of oil for protection. So you need a strong oil to reduce friction, and to help increase horsepower and fuel economy. To combat the increased pressures faced in today’s engines, Castrol EDGE is engineered with fluid titanium technology that physically changes the way the oil behaves under pressure. Castrol’s patented titanium technology provides documented performance in friction reduction, anti-wear and deposit control protection. The titanium-based technology ensures performance and strength.",

      "Motor oil is made from crude oil and is used to lubricate, clean, and cool engines. Types of motor oil include conventional, synthetic, diesel, bio-based, hybrid (blends of conventional and synthetic), and recycled oils. Motor oil varies in weight and viscosity, as well as additives that some manufacturers add to the oil during the refining process. A numerical code system created by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) grades motor oils according to viscosity, the higher the number between 0 and 60, the more viscous (thicker) the oil is. Most consumer motor oils are graded by two numbers, with the first number indicating cold weather (Winter or 'W') performance. This oil has a weight of SAE 40, meaning it has a single SAE viscosity rating of 40 at normal operating temperature. Always check your vehicle's owner's manual to verify that this is the correct weight of motor oil for your vehicle. This oil is fully synthetic, meaning crude oil is not used in making it. Synthetic oil can be used in vehicle engines instead of motor oils refined from crude oil, and often provides superior mechanical performance over traditional motor oil, including increased gas mileage and reduced engine wear at extreme temperatures. Its complex method of production means it can often cost more than conventional motor oil. Royal Purple Motor Oil Combines premium base oils with proprietary additive technologies to create high performance motor oils that optimize engine performance and provide superior protection. No special procedures are necessary when upgrading to Royal Purple. Royal Purple recommends waiting until the manufacturer's first scheduled oil change in new gasoline engines before upgrading to Royal Purple. Royal Purple's API licensed motor oil delivers superior protection and improves performance in gasoline and diesel engines.

The unique combination of base stocks and additives allow Red Line gear oils to carry higher loads compared to petroleum lubricants. The stability of these products allow them to be used for extended periods. Red Line 75W90 Gear Oil provides excellent protection in nearly all differentials, conventional and limited slip, in both racing and street use. 75W90NS and 75W140NS can be used in certain limited-slip units in racing to lock-up the differential. 80W140 should be used in commercial hauling, problem limited-slip units, racing applications which see tremendous torque at low speeds, and where noise deadening is desired. 75W85 can be used to obtain maximum power transfer in racing differentials which do not see extremely high temperatures and improved efficiency in street differentials. If “chattering” occurs with any of these lubricants, Red Line Limited Slip Friction Modifier can be used to eliminate the stick/slip action and reduce the noise. This additive should not be necessary in the 75W85, 75W90, 75W110, 75W140 or the 80W140 Gear Oils, since they already contain this additive, but in some units more is required.

Engineered for today’s advanced and hybrid engines, Mobil 1 Advanced Fuel Economy full-synthetic motor oil 0W-20 helps to improve fuel economy* and extend engine life for vehicles of all ages. Mobil 1 Advanced Fuel Economy utilizes Mobil 1’s signature Triple Action Formula to deliver outstanding engine performance, protection, and cleanliness to your vehicle. Specialty components in synthetic oil reduce friction, helping to prevent deposits and sludge buildup to keep critical engine parts clean and protected for up to 10,000 miles between oil changes.** This technologically advanced formulation offers outstanding engine efficiency, wear protection, internal engine heat protection (up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit), and low-temperature protection (to -40 degrees Fahrenheit)—bringing quick cold-weather starting and ultra-fast protection to your engine. Mobil 1 Advanced Fuel Economy meets ILSAC GF-6 standards to help provide low-speed pre-ignition (LSPI) and timing chain wear protection while keeping your engine clean and helping to improve your fuel economy. Mobil 1 Advanced Fuel Economy full-synthetic motor oil 0W-20 also helps control oxidation to prevent oil breakdown and is recommended by ExxonMobil for all types of modern vehicles, including high-performance, turbo-charged, and supercharged gasoline and diesel multi-valve fuel-injected engines found in passenger cars, SUVs, light vans, and light trucks. Mobil 1 is America’s #1 selling synthetic motor oil brand at retail,*** trusted and recommended by car builders and experienced mechanics, and is the Official Motor Oil of NASCAR(R). (*Potential fuel economy improvement obtained by switching from higher-viscosity oils to a lower-viscosity grade. Actual savings are dependent upon vehicle/engine type, outside temperature, driving conditions, and your current engine oil viscosity. **Protects for up to 10,000 miles or 1 year, whichever comes first.
